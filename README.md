Neural Style Transfer

Neural Style Transfer allows us to combine the style of an image with the content of a natural image by manipulating the feature representations learned by a Convolutional Neural Network. For example, it can enable us to transfer the style from Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night to an image of Neckarfront in TÃ¼bingen.
